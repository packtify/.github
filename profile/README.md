# Packtify

Packtify is a programming language and library collection that serves as a superset of multiple programming languages. Code written in Packtify can be seamlessly generated into other programming languages.

## Motivation

The goal of Packtify is to create a language and library collection that can be used as an archive or library for other programming languages. By providing a tool that can generate code from Packtify to other languages, developers can support multiple software platforms.
